**Hi :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist, modeler, and aspiring student actively searching for a PhD study or work opportunity. 
I can help you understand concepts in formal, philosophical and applied ontology development and use, as well as knowledge modeling ([See education services (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education)).  A speciality is knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies, metadata) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and other disciplines :earth_americas:. I'm a member of semantic/ontology, aerospace, and other associations. Another specialty is abstract (or upper/foundational) ontology development. Another focus is [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics in ontology development and use. In my free time I pursue service & training in water search & rescue.

**I'm available for hire** ([see ontology service list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099)), and **actively searching for a PhD studensthip opportunity, globally (authorized to work in US, EU, UK)**.
