**Hi there :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist and modeler. [Schedule a meeting at this link](https://my.setmore.com/bookingpage/f18db686-98bb-41dd-9097-35218b2a1091). I can [help you understand essential concepts (and misinformation)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education) in ontology development, use, and general knowledge modeling.  

One speciality is knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and related disciplines :earth_americas:. I'm a member of the NASA Datanauts, and I serve in various spaceflight associations, as well as semantic technology groups. A second specialty is upper ontology development. Another research focus is [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics in ontology development. As a philosopher by degree, I'm skilled in the most abstract concepts of ontology and conceptual modeling.  In my free time I pursue training and service in water search & rescue, and am a certified mariner. 

I'm [available for hire](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099), and also actively searching for a PhD studentship opportunity. If you find value in my work or publications (all unfunded), please consider [supporting here](https://gogetfunding.com/knowledge-organization-services-ontology-terminology-metadata-concept-analysis/).
