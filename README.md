**Hi there :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist, modeler, and aspiring student actively searching for a study or work opportunity and a career-path. 
In the meantime, I can help you understand concepts in formal, philosophical and applied ontology development, use, and knowledge modeling ([see education services list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education)).  A speciality is knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies, metadata) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and related disciplines :earth_americas:. I'm a member of the aerospace, semantic/ontology, and other associations. A second specialty is abstract or upper ontology development. A third research focus is [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics in ontology development and use. In my free time I pursue training and service in water search & rescue, and am a certified mariner. [Hire me for ontology consulting here](https://tinyurl.com/34u9w6wx)

**I'm available for hire** ([see ontology service list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099)), and also actively searching for a PhD studensthip opportunity.
