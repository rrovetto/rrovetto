**Hi :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist, modeler, and aspiring student actively searching for study (PhD studentship) or employment opportunities. 
I can help clarify complex concepts in formal, philosophical and applied ontology development and use, as well as semantic and knowledge modeling ([See education services (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education)). I can help create or improve your terminologies, ontologies, and metadata. A specialty is for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) :earth_americas:. I'm a member of semantic/ontology, aerospace, and other associations. Other specialties are abstract (or upper/foundational) ontology, and [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics in ontology/semantic modeling. In my free time I pursue service & training in water search & rescue, and am a skilled amateur photographer.

**I'm available for hire** ([see ontology service list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099)), and **actively searching for a PhD studensthip opportunity, globally (authorized to work in US, EU, UK)**.
