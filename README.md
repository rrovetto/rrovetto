**Hi there :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist, modeler, and aspiring student searching for a study or work opportunity. 
In the meantime, I can help you understand concepts (and clearup misinformation) in ontology development, use, and general knowledge modeling ([education services list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education)).  One speciality is knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies, metadata) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and related disciplines :earth_americas:. I'm a member of the NASA Datanauts, and I serve in various spaceflight associations. I also serve in semantic technology groups. A second specialty is abstract upper ontology development. A third research focus is [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics in ontology development. As a philosopher by degree, I'm skilled in the most abstract concepts of ontology and conceptual modeling. In my free time I pursue training and service in water search & rescue, and am a certified mariner. 

**I'm available for hire** ([see ontology service list (PPT)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099)), and also actively searching for a PhD studensthip opportunity.
