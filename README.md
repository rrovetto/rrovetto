:smiley: - I currently do formal ontology, conceptual data modeling (e.g., MBSE), philosophy, terminology, and spaceflight research, while searching & applying for PhD study options. I have 22 [publications](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-7817), and I serve in semantic web, ontology, aerospace, maritime safety, and (inter)national standards orgs. I can help **clarify complex concepts** in formal, philosophical and computational ontology development and use, as well as semantic and knowledge modeling. I can help **create or improve terminologies, ontologies, and metadata**. Specialties are (1) ontology & terminology for [spaceflight](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) :earth_americas:, (2)  _generic (or foundational/upper) ontology_, and (3) _[ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological and fundamental topics_ in ontology/semantic modeling. I also pursue service & training in water search & rescue ([services list](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgl1npz51amp3lm/BoatingServices_Rovetto_Apr2020.pdf?dl=0)), and digital [photography](https://tinyurl.com/y3k34cfb).
