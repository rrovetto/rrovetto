_Space + Conceptual modeling_
- Knowledge Representation for Space Sciences<details><summary>Click to read Abstract</summary>
Presently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a trending topic as well as a growing concern. Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is a branch of AI which applies formal methods to computationally capture content of various sorts. Related to KRR is so-called semantic technology and modeling, broadly construed to include various semantic systems, more commonly called knowledge organization systems (KOS). This presentation describes an interdisciplinary project and framework concept, exploring these approaches for space sciences, broadly construed to include astronomy-related (including Earth and solar science) as well as astronautical-related (spaceflight) topics. This includes the development of semantic models, e.g., ontologies, taxonomies, classifications, for application to space data, open data and stakeholder content. Specifically, semantic models for near-Earth space environments, as well as scientific content, and also applications (such as orbital debris remediation and data-sharing) are particular models. The project has described a knowledge network, a phrase sometimes used in the concept of a knowledge commons. Moreover, various development tracks for the project have been identified, demonstrating a valuable, broadly-applicable, and innovative vision for helping science flourish. In line with the session scope and description, the project seeks to research and develop the potential of such approaches (KRR, KOS, etc.) to, among other things, "integrate more data about the complex world". Related works by the author can be seen in affiliate organizations and events, such as in 2022 ESIP conference; and others via the project website https://ontospace.wordpress.com. Interested parties are strongly encouraged to contact the author.
Plain-Language Summary:
There's vast amounts of existing data, growing volumes of data, and increasing complexity in the space-related disciplines. This presentation describes an interdisciplinary project that, in part, hopes to help leverage and understand that data for various applications. It hopes to do so by researching topics in artificial intelligence, and developing systems to classify, describe, and link space content. This also hopes to express space knowledge in the process. </details>

  <details><summary>Click to read Abstract</summary>"Ethical considerations of ontology development and use, and semantic modeling, has not been treated, let alone given any significant attention. By contrast, the ethics of artificial intelligence is of increasing importance as technology plays a greater role in our lives. I assert that semantic aspects, in particular, must be given ethical and moral attention. This paper briefly introduces concepts for what can be a new field of inquiry with both theoretical and practical value: the ethics of ontology and semantic modeling, development and use."</details>

It lists specific topics to be pursued in a proposed ethics of computational ontology research discipline, which may be a branch of the ethics of artificial intelligence or information ethics. Example topics are ontological assumptions, transparency, ontology monopoly, etc. A focus is with ethical aspects of the most abstract or generic models, i.e., so-called generic, foundational, core, top level, or upper ontologies. Although this paper emphasizes computational ontologies, the presented points may be applicable to other knowledge organization systems, e.g., taxonomies, controlled vocabularies, semantic (data) models, knowledge graphs, conceptual (data) models, knowledge models, etc. As such a broader name for this ethical inquiry may be the ‘ethics of knowledge modeling’. The ethics of ontology has both theoretical and practical relevance: as a topic that is has not been given serious attention, and given applicable themes and concerns such as data sharing, privacy, classification, militarization, consent, ideology, etc."</details>

  <details><summary> Click to read the Abstract</summary>"Every discipline and topic of interest is, arguably, subject to myths and misinformation. This is no different for semantic technology, artificial intelligence, computational ontology, conceptual modeling, and topics therein. It is reasonable to assume that members of the given discipline have an ethical obligation to clear any myths or misinformation. This short paper lists some myths in ontology development and use, replacing them with the facts or truth of the matter. In the course of doing so, I clarify some clichés or idioms (often used in many disciplines) that have been erroneously used in contemporary ontology engineering. I will explain what I call: the myths of mappings, the myth of (re)use, and the myth of reinvention. This activity can be seen as the start of a new aspect, if not a branch of inquiry, of semantic modeling and technology: the ethics of (and in) semantic and ontology development. As such, it may be a branch of the ethics of AI. A living survey is providing support for the facts expressed here."</details>

_Knowledge Representation_
- "Toward a formal representation of responsibility", 2023
  <details> <summary>Click to read Abstract</summary>This work takes steps toward a formal representation of responsibility for both philosophical any technical communities. Relevant communities include: artificial intelligence(AI) (e.g., knowledge representation and reasoning), conceptual modeling, formal ontology, ethics of AI, etc. Preliminary conceptual work toward symbolically defining responsibility for computational modeling is discussed. It begins by drawing on intuitions of responsibility for persons, and then extending the analysis to describe responsibility associated with computational agents (i.e. machines). First-order predicate logic is used for symbolically characterizing responsibility as an n-ary relation which takes into account other essential aspects and factors. Those aspects are included as other concepts, i.e., arguments in the formalization, each of which is discussed. This demonstrates the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of responsibility (or our concepts thereof), as well as the variety of potential modeling approaches and formal representations that are possible. As a presently unfunded research project, interested parties in formally supporting/collaborating are encouraged to make contact with the author. </details>
