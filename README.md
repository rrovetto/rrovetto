:smiley: - I'm available for hire to do formal ontology, conceptual data modeling (e.g., in MBSE), semantic modeling, concept analysis, philosophy, terminology, and spaceflight research. I'm actively searching globally for a PhD study opportunity. I have [articles](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-7817), and serve in (inter)national committees on ontology, semantic tech., aerospace, maritime safety, and standards orgs. I can help **clarify complex concepts** in formal, philosophical and computational ontology, and semantic/knowledge modeling, as well as help you understand ethical aspects thereof. I can help **create or improve terminologies, ontologies, and metadata**.

Specialties are (1) ontology & terminology for [spaceflight](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) :earth_americas:, (2)  _generic (or foundational/upper) ontology_, and (3) _[ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological and fundamental topics_ in ontology development & use. I also pursue service & training in water search & rescue ([services list](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgl1npz51amp3lm/BoatingServices_Rovetto_Apr2020.pdf?dl=0)), and digital [photography](https://tinyurl.com/y3k34cfb). 

**YOUR SUPPORT:** The efforts in these GitHub repositories need funding, or a work or study opportunity, to sustain. Please [contact me](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact/) to offer support or opportunities.
**Actively open to study (PhD studentship), formal partnerships, & employment opportunities, worldwide.** (authorized to work in US, EU).
