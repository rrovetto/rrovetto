**Hi :smiley:** - I'm a formal ontologist, conceptual data modeler (MBSE), and terminologist with 22 publications. I serve in semantic web, ontology, aerospace, and (inter)national standards organizations. I can help **clarify complex concepts** in formal, philosophical and applied ontology development and use, as well as semantic and knowledge modeling. I can help create or improve terminologies, ontologies, and metadata. Specialties are ontology & terminology for [spaceflight](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) :earth_americas:, as well as _generic (or foundational/upper) ontology_, and _[ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational topics_ in ontology/semantic modeling. I also pursue service & training in water search & rescue, and am skilled at amateur digital photography.

**I'm actively open to both study (PhD studentship) and employment opportunities, worldwide.** (authorized to work in US, EU)
