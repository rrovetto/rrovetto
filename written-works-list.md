  <details><summary>Click to read Abstract</summary>"Ethical considerations of ontology development and use, and semantic modeling, has not been treated, let alone given any significant attention. By contrast, the ethics of artificial intelligence is of increasing importance as technology plays a greater role in our lives. I assert that semantic aspects, in particular, must be given ethical and moral attention. This paper briefly introduces concepts for what can be a new field of inquiry with both theoretical and practical value: the ethics of ontology and semantic modeling, development and use."</details>

  <details><summary> Click to read the Abstract</summary>"Every discipline and topic of interest is, arguably, subject to myths and misinformation. This is no different for semantic technology, artificial intelligence, computational ontology, conceptual modeling, and topics therein. It is reasonable to assume that members of the given discipline have an ethical obligation to clear any myths or misinformation. This short paper lists some myths in ontology development and use, replacing them with the facts or truth of the matter. In the course of doing so, I clarify some clichés or idioms (often used in many disciplines) that have been erroneously used in contemporary ontology engineering. I will explain what I call: the myths of mappings, the myth of (re)use, and the myth of reinvention. This activity can be seen as the start of a new aspect, if not a branch of inquiry, of semantic modeling and technology: the ethics of (and in) semantic and ontology development. As such, it may be a branch of the ethics of AI. A living survey is providing support for the facts expressed here."</details>
