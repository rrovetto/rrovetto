**Hi there ðŸ‘‹** - I'm a formal ontologist and modeler, with a speciality in knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and related disciplines. I can help you and your team understand essential concepts (and misinformation) in ontology development, conceptual modeling, and knowledge representation and reasoning. I'm available for hire, and actively searching for work and study (phd) opportunities. Ethical,  methodological, and foundational (abstract) topics in ontology design, engineering and use is one topic of interest. I'm also a philosopher by degree, and a certified mariner with experience training and volunteering in water search & rescue (a career goal). Say hi (rrovetto[at]terpalum[dot]umd[dot]edu)
