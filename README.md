**Hi there ðŸ‘‹** - I'm a formal ontologist and modeler with a speciality in knowledge organization systems (e.g. terminologies, ontologies) for [astronautics](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) and related disciplines. I can [help your team understand essential concepts (and misinformation)](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-courses-education) in ontology development and use, as well as knowledge representation and reasoning. I'm [available for hire](https://www.slideshare.net/RobertRovetto/ontology-services-238070099), and actively searching for work and study (PhD) opportunities. Another interest is [ethical](https://github.com/rrovetto/Ethical-Ontology-Development), methodological, and foundational (abstract) topics in ontology development. As a philosopher by degree, I'm skilled in the most abstract concepts of ontology and conceptual modeling. In my free time I search for training and service in water rescue & first-response, and am a certified mariner. Contact me at rrovetto[at]terpalum[dot]umd[dot]edu
