_Context_: At the time of this submission I predicted that someone or some org. in the future may run with my concept (potentially IP violate my work), so I documented the process. Sadly, events have transpired with suggest this. In more than one discipline I've had concepts and begun works ahead of their time. And whenever trying to find support to realize them, a pattern emerges that exemplifies the selfish side of humanity: I find in the future that those I communicated with pursue it without my knowledge.
